    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gallo Pinto means, quite literally, “Spotted Rooster” in Spanish, characterizing 
        the speckled appearance of the dark beans against the white rice.
        It’s typically served as a part of a hearty breakfast, alongside fried or 
        scrambled eggs, with accompaniments such as sour cream (“natilla” in Costa Rica, 
        which is thinner than the American variety), a crispy slice of fried white cheese 
        (“queso frito”), plantains, sliced avocado, a corn tortilla, and a strong cup of 
        coffee.
